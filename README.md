# Check_MK Documentation
Welcome to our Check_MK documentation. This project is primarily used by 
[https://spearhead.systems](Spearhead) employeed as part of our training
and quickstart guides when starting out with Check_MK. 
We are delighted if it can help others as well.

This documentation is based on the Check_MK 
Enterprise Edition (CEE). The majority of the information here should apply
to the open source (RAW) versions as well.

If you find mistakes or would like to contribute please dive in by submitting
 a PR.
